Yes, that one-time change should permanently fix the login issue you're experiencing.

Here's a brief explanation of why:

1.  **The Problem:** Your browser was blocking the `app_auth` session cookie. This happens because the `dietfantasy` site is running inside an iframe on a different domain, and modern browsers have strict security rules about these "cross-site" cookies to protect your privacy.

2.  **The Cause:** The cookie was set with `SameSite=Lax`. This setting tells the browser *not* to send the cookie with most cross-site requests, which is why your login session wasn't being created after you entered the correct password.

3.  **The Solution:** Changing the setting to `SameSite=None; Secure;` explicitly and securely allows this specific cookie to be sent even when `dietfantasy` is in an iframe. The `Secure` part is a requirement for this to work, ensuring the cookie is only sent over HTTPS (which your Vercel site uses).

This change directly targets the root cause of the login loop. You shouldn't need to make any other changes for this specific problem.
